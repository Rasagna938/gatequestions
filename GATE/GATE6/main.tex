\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $a_r$, $a_\phi$, and $a_z$ be unit vectors along $r$, $\theta$, and $z$ directions, respectively, in the cylindrical coordinate system. For the electric flux density given by
    $
    \mathbf{D} = a_r 15 + a_\theta 2r - a_z 3rz \text{ Coulomb/m}^2\text{}
    $,
    the total electric flux, in Coulomb, emanating from the volume enclosed by a solid cylinder of radius 3 m and height 5 m oriented along the z-axis with its base at the origin is:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 54 $\pi$
        \item 90 $\pi$
        \item 108 $\pi$
        \item 180 $\pi$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A stable real linear time-invariant system with a single pole at $p$, has a transfer function
    $$
    H(s) = \frac{s^2 + 100}{s-p}
    $$
    with a dc gain of 5. The smallest positive frequency, in rad/s, at unity gain is closest to

        \item 8.84
        \item 11.08
        \item 78.13
        \item 122.87
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The number of purely real elements in a lower triangular representation of a given $3 \times 3$ matrix, obtained through decomposition is {\underline{\hspace{1cm}}}.

    \item The figure below shows the per-phase Open Circuit Characteristics (measured in V) and Short Circuit Characteristics (measured in A) of a 14 kVA, 400 V, 50 Hz, 4-pole, 3-phase, delta connected alternator, driven at 1500 rpm. The field current, $I_f$ is measured in A. Readings taken are marked as respective $(x, y)$ coordinates in the figure.Ratio of the unsaturated and saturated synchronous impedances $(Z_{s(unsat)}/Z_{s(sat)})$ of the alternator is closest to:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 2.100
        \item 2.025
        \item 2.000
        \item 1.000

    \item Let $a_x$ and $a_y$ be unit vectors along $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. A vector function is given by:
    $$
    \mathbf{F} = a_x y - a_y x
    $$
    The line integral of the above function 
    $$\int_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
    along the curve $C$, which follows the parabola $y = x^2$ as shown below is {\underline{\hspace{1cm}}} (rounded off to 2 decimal places).

    \item A resistor and a capacitor are connected in series to a 10 V dc supply through a switch. The switch is closed at $t = 0$, and the capacitor voltage is found to cross 0 V at $t=0.4\tau$, where $\tau$ is the circuit time constant. The absolute value of percentage change required in the initial capacitor voltage if the zero crossing has to happen at $t= 0.2\tau$ is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}} (rounded off to 2 decimal places).
  
    \item A cylindrical rotor synchronous generator with constant real power output and constant terminal voltage is supplying 100 A current to a 0.9 lagging power factor load. An ideal reactor is now connected in parallel with the load, as a result of which the total lagging reactive power requirement of the load is twice the previous value while the real power remains unchanged. The armature current is now {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}(rounded off to 2 decimal places).
   
    \item Bus 1 with voltage magnitude $V_1=1.1$ pu is sending reactive power $Q_{12}$ towards bus 2 with voltage magnitude $V_2 =1$ pu through a lossless transmission line of reactance $X$. Keeping the voltage at bus 2 fixed at 1 pu, the magnitude of voltage at bus 1 is changed, so that the reactive power $Q_{12}$ sent from bus 1 is increased by 20\%.Real power flow through the line under both the conditions is zero. The new value of the voltage magnitude, $V_1$, in pu  (rounded off to 2 decimal places), at bus 1 is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.

    \item Windings 'A', 'B', and 'C' have 20 turns each and are wound on the same iron core as shown, along with winding 'X' which has 2 turns.The figure shows the sense (clockwise/anti-clockwise) of each of the windings only and does not reflect the exact number of turns. If windings 'A', 'B', and 'C' are supplied with balanced 3-phase voltages at 50 Hz and there is no core saturation, the no-load RMS voltage (in V, rounded off to 2 decimal places) across winding 'X' is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.

    \item A cylindrical rotor synchronous generator has steady state synchronous reactance of 0.7 pu and subtransient reactance of 0.2 pu. It is operating at $(1 +j0)$ pu terminal voltage with an internal emf of $(1+j0.7)$ pu. Following a three-phase solid short circuit fault at the terminal of the generator, the magnitude of the subtransient internal emf (rounded off to 2 decimal places) is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}} pu.
    
    \item In the dc-dc converter circuit shown, switch $Q$ is switched at a frequency of 10 kHz with a duty ratio of 0.6. All components of the circuit are ideal, and the initial current in the inductor is zero. Energy stored in the inductor in mJ (rounded off to 2 decimal places) at the end of 10 complete switching cycles is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.
  
    \item A single-phase, full-bridge, fully controlled thyristor rectifier feeds a load comprising a 10 $\Omega$ resistance in series with a very large inductance. The rectifier is fed from an ideal 230 V, 50 Hz sinusoidal source through cables which have negligible internal resistance and a total inductance of 2.28 mH. If the thyristors are triggered at an angle $\alpha = 45^\circ$, the commutation overlap angle in degree (rounded off to 2 decimal places) is{\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.
   
    \item A non-ideal Si-based pn junction diode is tested by sweeping the bias applied across its terminals from -5 V to +5 V. The effective thermal voltage, $V_T$, for the diode is measured to be (29 $\pm$ 2) mV. The resolution of the voltage source in the measurement range is 1 mV. The percentage uncertainty (rounded off to 2 decimal places) in the measured current at a bias voltage of 0.02 V is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.
