    \item The form and friction drags together contribute to the total drag when flow of air occurs past any object. Two orientations of a finite flat plate are shown in the figure. In Orientation-1, the plate is placed perpendicular to the flow, while in Orientation-2, the plate is placed parallel to the flow. If the velocity $(V)$ of air in both orientations is the same, which one of the following options is TRUE?

    \item A spherical ball is steadily supported against gravity by an upward air jet. Take acceleration due to gravity to be $g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2$. The mass flow rate of air, reaching the ball, is $0.01 \, \text{kg/s}$, and the air reaches the ball at an upward velocity of $3 \, \text{m/s}$. Neglecting the buoyancy force, and using the principle of integral momentum balance, the mass (in grams, up to one decimal place) of the ball is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.

    \item A spherical metal ball (of density $\rho_s$ and diameter $D$), attached to a string, is exposed to a crossflow (of velocity $U_{\infty}$) of a viscous fluid (of viscosity $\mu$ and density $\rho_f$). Due to the crossflow, the string makes an angle of inclination, $\theta$, with the top surface as shown in the figure. The acceleration due to gravity is denoted by $g$. For this flow, Reynolds number, $\text{Re}=\frac{{\rho_f}U_{\infty}D}{\mu} \ll 1$ and buoyancy force in the fluid is negligible compared to viscous force. Assuming the string to be weightless and offering negligible drag, derive the expression for $\theta$ is

    \item In a Cartesian coordinate system, a steady, incompressible velocity field of a Newtonian fluid is given by 
    $$\vec{V} = u_0(1 - ay^2) \, \hat{i}$$
    Here, $V$ is the velocity vector in $m/s$, i is the unit vector in the x-direction,$u_0$ is a positive, real constant (in $m/s$), and $a$ is a positive, real constant (in $m^{-2}$). The viscosity of the fluid is $\mu$ (in Pa$\cdot$s). Determine the absolute value of the pressure gradient (in Pa/m) is 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $a \mu u_0$
        \item $2a \mu u_0$
        \item $3a \mu u_0$
        \item $4a \mu u_0$

    \end{enumerate}

    \item In a laminar, incompressible, fully-developed pipe flow of a Newtonian fluid,as shown in the figure, the velocity profile over a cross-section is given by $$v = U(1 - r^2/R^2)$$ where $U$ is a constant. The pipe length is $L$ and the fluid viscosity is $\mu$. The power $P$ required to sustain the flow is expressed as $P = c\mu LU^2$, where $c$ is a dimensionless constant.The value of the constant $c$ (up to one decimal place) is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.

    \item The two-dimensional velocity field $\vec{V}$ of a flow in a Cartesian coordinate system is given in dimensionless form by $$\vec{V} = (x^2-axy) \, \hat{i} + (bxy-\frac{y^2}{2}) \, \hat{j}$$
    Here, i and j are the unit vectors along the x and y directions respectively, $a$ and $b$ are independent of x,y and time. If the flow is incompressible,then the value of $(a - b)$, up to one decimal place is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.

    \item For the configuration shown in the figure, oil of density $800 \, \text{kg/m}^3$ lies above water of density $1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3$. Assuming hydrostatic conditions and acceleration due to gravity $g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2$, the length $L$ (in meters, up to one decimal place) of water in the inclined tube {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.

    \item A two-dimensional Eulerian velocity field is given (in m/s) by $\vec{V} = \left( \sqrt{5} x \right) \, \hat{i} - \left( \sqrt{12} y \right) \, \hat{j}$, where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates (in meters) in a Cartesian coordinate system.The magnitude of the acceleration (in $\text{m/s}^2$, up to one decimal place) of a fluid particle at $x = 1 \, \text{m}$ and $y = -1 \, \text{m}$ is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.
   

    \item A large pump is to deliver oil at an average velocity $V$ of  1.5$m/s$. The pump has an impeller diameter $(D)$ of 40cm and the pressure rise across the pump is $400{kPa}$. To design this pump, a lab-scale model pump with an impeller diameter of $4{cm}$ is to be used with water as the fluid. The viscosity $(\mu)$ of the oil is 100 times that of water, and the densities $(\rho)$ of oil and water are identical. A complete geometric similarity is maintained between the model and prototype. If the pressure rise is a function only of $V$, $D$, $\rho$, and $\mu$, the pressure rise (in kPa, up to one decimal place) across the model pump is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.

    \item Water (density = $1000  \text{kg/m}^3$) enters steadily into a horizontal pipe bend, which is part of a larger piping system, as shown in the figure. The volumetric flow rate of water is $0.1 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}$. The gage pressure at the inlet is $500\text{kPa}$, while the exit is open to the atmosphere. The $x$-component of the force on the support $F_x$.The absolute value of $F_x$(in kN, up to one decimal place) is {\underline{\hspace{2cm}}}.
